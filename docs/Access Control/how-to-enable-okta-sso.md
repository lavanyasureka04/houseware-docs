Houseware uses [WorkOS](https://workos.com/) for SSO. WorkOS is a modern API platform that empowers any developer to quickly build and ship enterprise features: [Single Sign-On (SAML)](https://workos.com/single-sign-on), [Directory Sync (SCIM)](https://workos.com/directory-sync), and [Admin Portal (enterprise onboarding)](https://workos.com/admin-portal).

WorkOS accelerates SaaS companies like Houseware in their journey to become Enterprise-Ready, so their app has all the features to be adopted ‘wall-to-wall’ in a large organization. It is trusted by leading SaaS organizations like Vercel, Hopin, Loom, Pitch, Drata, and Webflow.

To enable Okta SSO for Houseware:

1. Contact your Houseware success manager for a WorkOS magic link.
2. Use the magic link on WorkOS to set up an Okta application for Houseware.
3. Your Houseware workspace is now Okta enabled! 🎉 

You can add users in your organization to the Okta application to grant them access to the Houseware application.
